Alvinn: 
Woow. What is it?
ARI: 
T  y   e p  t cle d te to ...  
Alvinn: 
ARI?
Alvinn:
That's weird. The signal seems to be failing.
Alvinn:
ARI? 
Alvinn: 
ARI??????!
ARI:
Something is disturbing our signal. But now everything is okay.
ARI:
Well, particle detectors are machines designed to detect, photograph the trails left by elementary particles. 
ARI:
Only electrically charged particles can be photographed because of their ionizing power, in this case the power to remove or add electrons to atoms. 
ARI:
In short, particles that have their paths bent in opposite directions have opposite charges.
ARI:
The analysis of the curvature of the trajectories also informs the masses of the particles involved in the processes.
Alvinn:
Hum... I can do the same thing as this machine...
Alvinn:
Que estranho '-'
ARI: 
How I said before, your father have to put some devices on you, to save your life. 
ARI:
You should see it with kind eyes.
ARI:
It must be nice to have the ability to track the particles.
Alvinn:
Beautiful they are, very much. Too bad they hurt me if I do not activate my force field.
Alvinn:
But in compensation ... hahahaha ...
ARI:
What is it, Alvinn?
Alvinn:
The robots here, when they are destroyed, they drop a green fluid.
Alvinn:
This fluid, somehow, heals the damage done by particles and robots. 
Alvinn:
That's nice. Something good in the middle of this chaos.
ARI:
That's interesting. Their capabilities go beyond what I imagined.
Alvinn:
Anyway. Back to our journey!
