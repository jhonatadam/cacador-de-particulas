ARI:
The photon is a particle mediating the electromagnetic force.
ARI:
Its decay is responsible for the creation of electron-positron pairs.
ARI:
Foton is represented by the Greek letter γ (gamma).
ARI:
The minimum energy of the photon to occur the generation of pairs is 1,022 MeV, but there are more energetic photons.
Alvinn:
Who would have thought an eight-year-old would be learning particle physics at the end of the world?
ARI:
There is a chance of 0.0000000093% chance of happening.
Alvinn:
How much precision '-'
