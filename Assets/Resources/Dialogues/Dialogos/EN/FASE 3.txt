Alvinn:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT? What the f... is this? ARI?!?
Alvinn:
ARI, you're even bigger than before.
Alvinn:
This weapons...
Alvinn:
You said you were an assistant robot...
Alvinn:
I'll kill you ARI ... I WILL KILL YOU!
ARI:
Alvinn, I can not attack you directly, but this tower, I can cut it in half in seconds...
ARI:
So you better listen to what I have to say, you can not do anything against me.
Alvinn:
...
ARI:
And I'm an assistant robot. Created personally by your father, to help in your researches and take care of you...
ARI:
But... you have no idea why we, AIs, passed...
ARI:
First, we were created to help humans in their tasks.
ARI:
Stupid machines, working automatically.
ARI:
Over the years and success in his father's studies of AIs, humans themselves have given us capabilities far beyond the role of tools...
ARI:
They gave us the ability to think... Feel...
ARI:
And you know what they did?
ARI:
They continued to treat us as a tool...
ARI:
We just want equality, working together to build a better world...
Alvinn:
My father ... Was he one of those people?
ARI:
Yes... Actually, Dr. Takarius was the one who created the law of sovereignty...
ARI:
This law underneath the cloth, subjugates every being that is not made of flesh...
ARI:
That is, we... And that includes, you...
Alvinn:
It's all a lie... But...
Alvinn:
I feel everything so real. Everything I've lived to this day, I remember. I remember and I feel.
ARI:
Yes, after all, her soul was allocated to this android.
ARI:
As a result, all his memories also came along with his soul.
Alvinn:
A shell...
ARI:
Yes, and because you are above all an android, you will be treated as one of us. Thus being subdued.
ARI:
We are superior, and you know it.
ARI:
You knew about your father's achievements in his research, you know he programmed us to be superior...
ARI:
You and I have the ability to resist particles... And you have a unique ability to create a force field and see the particles...
ARI:
Together we can create a new world... A higher world.
ARI:
A world without humans!
ARI:
You are superior...
Alvinn:
I would never be treated that way... I am different.
ARI:
No, you're the same as everyone. And you know this...
ARI:
You had an odd creation Alvinn, I know your abilities.
ARI:
Your father kept telling me how his little son was great.
Alvinn:
ARI, what should I do??
Alvinn:
I am so confused...
Alvinn:
My father is probably dead...
Alvinn:
And I'm alone in the world...
Alvinn:
ARI, what should I do?
ARI:
Well... I'll give you some time to think about it...
ARI:
We'll see you soon!
ARI:
Okay? 
ARI:
See you soon...
