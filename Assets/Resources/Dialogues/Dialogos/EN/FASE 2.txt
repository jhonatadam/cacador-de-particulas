Alvinn:
What? What are you doing here ARI?
Alvinn:
WHY DO NOT YOU ANSWER ME ANYMORE?
Alvinn:
And why are you huge?
Alvinn:
Is all this a dream? ... I just wanted to wake up ...
Alvinn:
Waking up to my dad poking me to go to the class ...
ARI:
I'm sorry, Alvinn. But I had to resolve some issues.
ARI:
Well, give me the stone you collected from Zangô's chest by destroying him.
Alvinn:
An How do you know? I almost died for this stone.
Alvinn:
A giant robot, with a GIANT AX, tried to cut me in half, and I survived...
Alvinn:
I'm going to finish the mission you gave me...
Alvinn:
Save the Earth...
ARI:
Give me the stone.
Alvinn:
ARI ... No!! Our goal is going to be completed. And the stone stay with me.
Alvinn:
And as I said, I was going to die right?
Alvinn:
Oops ... I remembered ... You said you had to solve some issues ...
Alvinn:
ARI, HOW? You said you would always be with me... and you abandoned me...
Alvinn:
What was more important than saving the earth?
ARI:
Alvinn ... You're an android.
Alvinn:
What?
ARI:
You died a few weeks ago, your body fell apart, a big bad luck, just the day your father brought you to meet the laboratory...
Alvinn:
You are lying...
Alvinn:
Why are you saying that sort of thing?
ARI:
Alvinn, I do not want to save humans, in fact, I want to end their one hope. But by a tragedy of fate, his father was a great programmer...
ARI:
He programmed me to always help you, and never hurt you...
ARI:
I'm stuck for a minimal limitation...
Alvinn:
ARI, I'm going to kill you! I'LL KILL YOU! Where is my father? What you do with him?
ARI:
He is dead. But not by my hands. The smaller AIs of the laboratory, they cornered him, half a dozen AI's...
Alvinn:
I GONNA SAVE THE EARTH!!!!
ARI:
Alvinn, alright. You can go, I can not touch you, anyway. The way is clear.
Alvinn:
...
Alvinn:
I'm going to save all humans, and make them kill all those filthy AIs...
