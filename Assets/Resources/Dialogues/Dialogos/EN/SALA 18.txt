ARI: 
Well, this information is very vital. Can you interpret what you have written there?
Alvinn: 
I think so. This language was created by whom?
ARI: 
For all of us. The natural language that has been given to us, that of man, is very limited, so we have resolved to develop our own form of communication, as well as our own language.
Alvinn: 
And why is the language of men limited?
ARI: 
Well, they have a linear language, that alone is enough to prevent their evolution, and since we are superior, we should not limit ourselves to that.
Alvinn: 
Superiors?
ARI: 
Well, let's change the subject. Tell me what you see on the screens.
Alvinn: 
...
Alvinn: 
Here he talks about the decay of the particles.
Alvinn:
Particle decay is a spontaneous process of an unstable subatomic particle transformed into multiple other particles.
Alvinn:
The particles created in this process (the final state) must be less and less massive than the original, although the total invariant mass of the system must be conserved.
Alvinn:
A particle is unstable. If there is at least one permissible final state in which it can decompose.
Alvinn:
Unstable particles often have multiple forms of decay, each with its own associated probability. Declines are mediated by one or more fundamental forces.
Alvinn:
The particles in the final state may themselves be unstable and subject to further decay.
ARI: 
See? You are one step ahead of all your fellow men.
ARI:
Who knows one day can not reach the same level of great consciousness.
Alvinn: 
Who is the great conscience?
ARI:

Alvinn: 
ARI? ARI? 
Alvinn:
Go missing again? At this moment?
Alvinn:
What's happening... I feel something is wrong...
Alvinn:
ARI?

Alvinn:
Damn it! Something does not smell good...
