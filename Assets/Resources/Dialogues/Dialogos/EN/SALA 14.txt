ARI, what was that? '-'
ARI:
Hum, I thought we were never going to bump with a Zevatron..
ARI:
But things are totally out of control and normal.
Alvinn:
And what is a Zevatron?
ARI:
It is a rare cosmic ray because it has enough energy compared to the others observed. Its energy is of the order of 10²¹eV (1ZeV). 
ARI:
Such particles are actually highly energetic protons or neutrons.
ARI:
The greatest doubt hanging over this cosmic ray is how it has attained such great energy.
Alvinn:
If such a particle strikes me, will I die?
ARI:
Of course, yes, then, best to avoid them.
