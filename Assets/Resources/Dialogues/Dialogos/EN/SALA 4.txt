Alvinn:
Look the size of THAT THING!!!
ARI: 
This is the LHC, the Large Hadron Collider. 
ARI:
They are machines built to study the fundamental components of the matter.
ARI:
In essence, the accelerators supply energy to a group of charged particles so that, when hit a specific value, throw them against a target.
Alvinn:
And what's the point of hitting a particle with something?
ARI:
The objective is to analyze the results of the collisions with this target and from this, to study this reaction.
Alvinn: 
Where are we, ARI? Look at the size of it!
Alvinn:
It is not natural, it takes a lot of space to build something of this size. It is not?
ARI:
We are on the border between Brazil and Uruguay, and this is the greatest accelerator.
ARI:
Actually, it takes a lot of machinery to operate this, and especially, a lot of energy to energize the particles.
